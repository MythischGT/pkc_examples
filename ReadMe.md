# Introduction
I will be providing mock implementations of known public-key cryptography key exchange algorithms such as:
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
    - Finite Field Version
    - Elliptic Curve Version (EC-DH)
- Signed Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- Station-to-Station Protocol
- Blake-Wilson-Menezes Protocol
- MQV Protocol
